-- Merge clock_in_self + clock_out_self into a single clock_self permission.
-- Original design split them by mistake — a worker who can clock in but not
-- out gets stuck clocked in forever, which is worse than not being able to
-- clock at all.
--
-- For every role that had EITHER of the old keys, grant clock_self. Then
-- delete the old rows. Idempotent: if the keys aren't present (fresh
-- install via the updated 0089), the migration is a no-op.
