-- TIMESTAMPTZ migration — Phase 1 backfill.
--
-- Populates the new start_ts / end_ts columns on time_entries and shifts,
-- and seeds users.timezone, from the existing wall-clock + timezone fields.
--
-- Backfill order matters:
--   1. users.timezone — derived from the most recent timezone the user
--      actually clocked in with, falling back to company_timezone, then UTC.
--      Done first so step 3 can read it.
--   2. time_entries.start_ts / end_ts — built from work_date + start/end_time
--      AT TIME ZONE (entry.timezone || company_timezone || most-frequent
--      entry tz for the company || UTC). Midnight-crossing entries
--      (end_time < start_time) get end_ts bumped by 1 day.
--   3. shifts.start_ts / end_ts — same idea but uses the assigned user's
--      timezone (now populated by step 1).
--
-- Wrapped in a single transaction so a partial run can't leave half the
-- rows in the new representation while half stay in the old.
--
-- Reports: a RAISE NOTICE block at the end prints per-company counts of
-- which fallback level was used for time_entries, so the deploy log
-- surfaces companies whose entries fell to the most-common-tz heuristic
-- or to pure UTC. Spot-check those before trusting the cutover.
